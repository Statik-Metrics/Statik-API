[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/Statik-Metrics/Statik-API.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/Statik-Metrics/Statik-API)

This is the API server for Statik. It's designed to be the public-facing
stats querying server, plus a form of API documentation.

This server is live at [api.statik.io](http://api.statik.io/).

Requirements
------------

To use this, you'll need the following.

* Python 3.4 or later
* The following Python libraries
    * bottle
    * mako
    * pymongo
    * pyyaml
* To run the development server, you'll need one of the
[supported Bottle backends](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/deployment.html#switching-the-server-backend).
    We suggest CherryPy.

Setting up
----------

* Install Python 3.4 or later if you haven't already
* Install the required libraries - You can do this quickly using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Enter the `config/` folder
    * Copy `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and fill it out.
    * Copy `database.yml.example` to `database.yml` and fill it out.
    * You can also do `development.yml.example` if you need to change the defaults for local testing.
* Launch the server
    * For testing, you can simply run `python run.py` or `python3 run.py`.
    * For production, you should *really* use uWSGI.
